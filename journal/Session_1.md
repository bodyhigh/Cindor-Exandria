## Journey Log

### Meeting Eleria Whispersong
Today began in the cozy Embered Hearth Tavern in Emberhold. As I nursed my drink, a striking woman with fiery red hair and emerald-green eyes approached me. This was Eleria Whispersong, a historian with a passion for ancient lore. She shared tales of the Lost Forge of the Spellsmith and the Elemental Blade of Prometheus, a blade tied to my ancestors. Eleria's knowledge and enthusiasm were infectious, and it wasn't long before we decided to join forces. Her insight into the ancient mysteries aligned perfectly with my quest, and I felt a renewed sense of purpose.

### Research at the Grand Library of Ashenwall
Our next stop was the Grand Library of Ashenwall, a vast repository of knowledge. The air was cool and still, filled with the faint scent of old parchment. With the help of Archivist Maren and the shadowy Rothgar the Rogue Scholar, we uncovered the blade's history. It was forged in the fires of creation, wielded by a champion who defied the gods, and lost during the Calamity. The blade is believed to be hidden in the Spellsmith's forge in Emberfall. Each discovery felt like a piece of my heritage being restored, and I could almost feel the weight of the blade in my hand as we pieced together its story.

### Assistance from Captain Zara Stormshield
Seeking further aid, we visited the City Guard Headquarters and met Captain Zara Stormshield. She provided us with maps, supplies, and critical information about the Hand of Ash's movements, cautioning us to maintain a low profile to avoid attracting the cult's attention. Captain Stormshield's no-nonsense demeanor and strategic mind were reassuring. Her assistance meant we were better prepared for the dangers ahead, and her belief in our mission bolstered our resolve.

### Journey through the Whispering Woods
We set out at first light towards the Whispering Woods, navigating through dense forests and treacherous terrain. The forest was alive with the sounds of nature, but there was an eerie silence beneath the canopy. We discovered a hidden path near the Old Watchtower and investigated an abandoned campsite. There, we found a pendant bearing the symbol of the Hand of Ash and a journal with notes about a ritual and a gathering at the stone circle. The campsite was a stark reminder of the cult's pervasive influence, and the artifacts we found were clues that would guide our next steps.

### Investigating the Stone Circle
Following the hidden path, we reached an ancient stone circle marked by glowing runes and remnants of a ritual setup. Tracks leading away from the circle indicated recent cult activity, adding another layer of urgency to our quest. The air was charged with lingering magic, and the runes seemed to whisper secrets of forgotten power. This discovery was both thrilling and ominous, a testament to the power and danger of our quest.
