## Journey Log

### Discovering More Clues
We returned to the stone circle, uncovering more clues about the Hand of Ash's next move. The lingering magic and the cult's meticulous preparations suggested something significant was about to happen. As we examined the site, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched, the forest itself seemed to hold its breath in anticipation.

### Tracking the Cultists
We tracked the cultists' movements through the forest, avoiding their traps and ambushes. The path led us deeper into the Whispering Woods, where the atmosphere grew more ominous with every step. The forest was a labyrinth of shadows and whispered secrets, each turn revealing new challenges.

### Encounter at the Secondary Ritual Site
Our pursuit led us to a secondary ritual site, guarded by more cultists. A fierce battle ensued, testing our combat skills and resolve. We managed to defeat the cultists and secure additional ritual notes and a map leading to another key location. The battle was intense, every swing of my sword and every spell cast felt like a fight for survival. Eleria's quick thinking and magical prowess were invaluable, turning the tide in our favor.
