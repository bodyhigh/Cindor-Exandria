  backstory: >
    Cindor is a Fire Genasi Eldritch Knight with a rich history tied to ancient forging techniques from the Age of Arcana. Born with the elemental heritage of fire, Cindor's fiery nature was evident from a young age. He was apprenticed to the Guild of Flame and Steel, where he mastered the art of sword-making. His relentless pursuit of perfection and esoteric knowledge often led him to study techniques considered blasphemous against the gods. Despite the controversy, Cindor's skills grew unparalleled, and he earned the title "Holder of the Dragon's Flame."

    Driven by a desire to uncover lost secrets and ancient artifacts, Cindor traveled the world, learning from master swordsmiths and seeking the legendary Elemental Blade of Prometheus. This blade, a powerful artifact from his ancestors, was lost during the Calamity and hidden in the Spellsmith's forge in Emberfall. Cindor's quest for the blade brought him to Emberhold, where he met Eleria Whispersong, a historian with a deep knowledge of ancient lore.

    Together, they embarked on a perilous journey through dense forests, treacherous mountains, and eerie swamps, uncovering clues about the Elemental Blade and the sinister cult of the Hand of Ash. Their adventures tested Cindor's martial prowess, arcane abilities, and unwavering determination. Along the way, Cindor's understanding of the balance between fire and steel deepened, solidifying his path as an Eldritch Knight dedicated to mastering both combat and magic.
